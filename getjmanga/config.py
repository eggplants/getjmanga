A `[site.<key>]` section is looked up by the URL's hostname first, then by the
extractor's `CONFIG_KEY`, so a per-host section beats the shared one.

`jm config` writes the file: `init` lays down a commented template, `site`
asks for an account, and `savedir` / `overwrite` / `bulk` / `both` set the
defaults (`bulk` and `both` rule each other out: setting one clears the other).
`-S` and `jm patrol` keep the `[[patrol]]` entries. The writes go through
tomlkit so the comments in a hand-edited file survive.
